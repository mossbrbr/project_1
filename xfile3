Adding another practice file to become a ninja at GIT and GitHUb.

Just adding more stuff.

Screwed up a bit on my GIT/GitHub refresher on xfile2
under xa21-infra_1118. I didn't perform a pull request
from GitHub prior to merging.

Should have run the git push origin master command
then performed a pull request from GitHub.
